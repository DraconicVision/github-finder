# React Commands

I'm documenting my use of React commands here.

This is mostly personal notes, [read the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/ 'ReactJS Docs').

## Create React App

`npx create-react-app <APP-NAME>`
This will create a boiler-plate single page React app in a folder within the directory you are currently in. Ex: If you run this command in `C:/` it will create the app in `C:/<APP-NAME>`

To create the app within directly within your current directory do:
`npx create-react-app .`
